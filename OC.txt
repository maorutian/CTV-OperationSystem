#The first one is displaying  the current data and time.
#The second one is counting lines, words, and characters in a specified file. Users can know lines, words, and characters in a file which they input.
#The third one is create an ASCII cow in terminal that will say what ever users want.It is the last function of the menu. It helps users know that the unix terminal is not always dull and boring. It does some funny acts to entertain the user.
